## ✨ Core Highlights

- 🤖 **Intelligent load balancing**: Weight + priority + grouping scheduler with built-in circuit breaker and up to three failover retries to keep requests stable.
- 🧩 **Multi-provider management**: Connect Claude, Codex, Gemini CLI, and OpenAI-compatible vendors simultaneously with per-provider model redirection and HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS proxy rules.
- 🛡️ **Rate limiting & concurrency control**: Enforce RPM, monetary quotas (5-hour / weekly / monthly), and session concurrency via Redis Lua scripts with atomic counters and fail-open degradation.
- 📘 **Automated OpenAPI docs**: 39 REST endpoints exported from Server Actions into OpenAPI 3.1.0, instantly browsable in Swagger and Scalar UI.
- 📊 **Real-time monitoring & analytics**: Dashboards, active sessions, consumption leaderboards, decision-chain tracing, and proxy health tracking provide second-level visibility.
- 💰 **Price sheet management**: Paginated SQL queries with debounce search and LiteLLM sync keep thousands of model prices searchable in milliseconds.
- 🔁 **Session management**: Five-minute context cache preserves decision trails, reduces vendor switches, and maintains full auditability.
- 🔄 **OpenAI-compatible endpoint**: Supports `/v1/chat/completions` (OpenAI-compatible format), passes through tool calls and reasoning fields, enforces strict same-format routing with no cross-format conversion.

## ⚡️ Quick Start

### Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose (latest version recommended)
- Optional (for local development): Node.js ≥ 22.15 (inbound zstd request-body decompression uses native `node:zlib` zstd), Bun ≥ 1.3

### 🚀 One-Click Deployment Script (✨ Recommended - Fully Automated)

The one-click deployment script **automatically handles** all of the following:

- Check and install Docker and Docker Compose (Linux/macOS support auto-install)
- Create deployment directory and configuration files
- Generate secure admin token and database password
- Start all services and wait for health checks
- Display access URLs and admin token

**Linux / macOS:**

```bash
# Download and run the deployment script
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ding113/claude-code-hub/main/scripts/deploy.sh -o deploy.sh
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

Or using wget:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ding113/claude-code-hub/main/scripts/deploy.sh
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell as Administrator):**

```powershell
# Download and run the deployment script
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ding113/claude-code-hub/main/scripts/deploy.ps1" -OutFile "deploy.ps1"
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
.\deploy.ps1
```

**Deployment Directories:**

- Linux: `/www/compose/claude-code-hub`
- macOS: `~/Applications/claude-code-hub`
- Windows: `C:\ProgramData\claude-code-hub`

**Branch Selection:**

The script will prompt you to select a deployment branch:

- `main` (default): Stable release, recommended for production
- `dev`: Development version with latest features, for testing

**Important Notes:**

- ⚠️ Please save the **Admin Token** displayed by the script - it's the only credential to access the admin dashboard!
- ⚠️ Windows users: If Docker Desktop is not installed, the script will automatically open the download page

### Three-Step Launch (Docker Compose)

1. **Clone and configure**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ding113/claude-code-hub.git
   cd claude-code-hub
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Edit configuration**

   Edit the `.env` file and **update** `ADMIN_TOKEN` (admin login token):

   ```bash
   # MUST change this!
   ADMIN_TOKEN=your-secure-token-here

   # Docker Compose defaults (usually no changes needed)
   DSN=postgres://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/claude_code_hub
   REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
   ```

3. **Start services**

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   Check status:

   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   docker compose logs -f app
   ```

### Access the application

Once started:

- **Admin Dashboard**: `http://localhost:23000` (login with `ADMIN_TOKEN` from `.env`)
- **API Docs (Scalar UI)**: `http://localhost:23000/api/actions/scalar`
- **API Docs (Swagger UI)**: `http://localhost:23000/api/actions/docs`

> 💡 **Tip**: To change the port, edit the `ports` section in `docker-compose.yml`.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### High-level view

```
Clients / CLI / Integrations
        │
        ▼
Next.js 16 App Router (v1 API routes)
        │
Hono + Proxy Pipeline (Auth → Session Allocation → Rate Limiting → Provider Selection → Forwarding → Response Handling)
        │
Multi-provider pool (Claude / OpenAI / Gemini / others) + PostgreSQL + Redis
```

- **App layer**: `src/app` hosts dashboards, settings, and API actions for UI and internal APIs.
- **Proxy core**: `src/app/v1/_lib/proxy-handler.ts` chains `ProxyAuthenticator`, `ProxySessionGuard`, `ProxyRateLimitGuard`, `ProxyProviderResolver`, `ProxyForwarder`, and `ProxyResponseHandler`.
- **Business logic**: `src/lib` contains rate limiting, session manager, circuit breaker, proxy utilities, and price-sync; `src/repository` encapsulates Drizzle ORM queries.
- **Documentation system**: `src/app/api/actions/[...route]/route.ts` converts Server Actions into OpenAPI endpoints automatically.

### Data flow & components

1. **Ingress**: Requests with API keys hit the Next.js route and pass through `ProxyAuthenticator`.
2. **Context control**: `SessionManager` fetches the five-minute cache from Redis, enforces concurrency, and records the decision chain.
3. **Rate limiting**: `RateLimitService` applies Lua-driven atomic counters for RPM, spend, and session caps, falling back gracefully if Redis is unavailable.
4. **Routing**: `ProxyProviderResolver` scores vendors with weights, priorities, breaker states, and session reuse, retrying up to three times.
5. **Forwarding & response handling**: `ProxyForwarder` sends requests upstream; `ProxyResponseHandler` processes response streams while preserving endpoint-native formats, with proxy support and model redirects.
6. **Observability**: Dashboards, leaderboards, and price sheets query PostgreSQL via repositories with hourly aggregations.

## 🚢 Deployment

### 🐳 Docker Compose (✨ Recommended, Production-Ready)

Docker Compose is the **preferred deployment method** — it automatically provisions the database, Redis, and application services without manual dependency installation, ideal for production quick-start.

1. Prepare `.env` (see `.env.example`) and point `DSN`/`REDIS_URL` to the Compose services.
2. Start the stack:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
3. Monitor:
   ```bash
   docker compose logs -f app
   docker compose ps
   ```
4. Upgrade:
   ```bash
   docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
   ```
   Stop and clean up with `docker compose down` when necessary.

### ☸️ Kubernetes / k3s (Production / HA / Multi-node)

The repo ships a **dual-compatible** (k3s + standard Kubernetes) one-click deploy script `scripts/deploy-k8s.sh` and a management CLI `scripts/cch`. Out of the box you get HPA autoscaling, PodDisruptionBudget, NetworkPolicy, rolling upgrades with automatic rollback on health check failure, and scheduled backups.

Quick start (auto-installs k3s if no cluster is detected):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ding113/claude-code-hub.git
cd claude-code-hub
bash scripts/deploy-k8s.sh --install-k3s -y
```

Standard Kubernetes with domain:

```bash
bash scripts/deploy-k8s.sh \
  --ingress-host hub.example.com \
  --ingress-class nginx \
  --storage-class standard \
  -y
```

Day-2 operations with `cch`:

```bash
cch status            # pods / HPA / resources
cch update            # rolling upgrade with auto-migrate and rollback on failure
cch backup            # PostgreSQL backup (gzip, keep 30)
cch info              # show access URL and admin token
cch doctor            # diagnose cluster + deployment
```

See **[docs/k8s-deployment.md](docs/k8s-deployment.md)** for full options, placeholders, cloud provider StorageClass mapping, and troubleshooting.

### Local development (dev toolchain)

1. Enter the `dev/` folder: `cd dev`.
2. Run `make dev` to launch PostgreSQL + Redis + `bun dev` in one command.
3. Helpful targets:
   - `make db`: start only database and Redis.
   - `make logs` / `make logs-app`: tail all services or app logs.
   - `make clean` / `make reset`: clean or fully reset the environment.
4. Use `make migrate` and `make db-shell` for schema operations.

### Manual deployment (bun build + start)

1. Install dependencies and build:
   ```bash
   bun install
   bun run build      # Copies the VERSION file automatically
   ```
2. Export environment variables via your process manager (systemd, PM2, etc.) and ensure PostgreSQL/Redis endpoints are reachable.
3. Launch production server:
   ```bash
   bun run start
   ```
4. You may keep `AUTO_MIGRATE=true` for the first run, then disable it and manage migrations explicitly with Drizzle CLI.

## ❓ FAQ

1. **Database connection failures**
   - Verify the `DSN` format and credentials; use service names (e.g., `postgres:5432`) within Docker.
   - Inspect `docker compose ps` or local PostgreSQL status, and use `make db-shell` for deeper checks.

2. **What if Redis goes offline?**
   - The platform uses a fail-open policy: rate limiting and session metrics degrade gracefully while requests continue flowing. Monitor logs for Redis errors and restore the service asap.

3. **Circuit breaker keeps opening**
   - Inspect `[CircuitBreaker]` logs to see whether repeated 4xx/5xx or network errors triggered it.
   - Check provider health in the admin console and wait 30 minutes or restart the app to reset state.

4. **“No provider available” errors**
   - Ensure providers are enabled, have reasonable weights/priorities, and haven’t hit concurrency or spend caps.
   - Review the decision-chain log to confirm whether breakers or proxy failures removed them.

5. **Proxy configuration issues**
   - Make sure URLs include a protocol (`http://`, `socks5://`, etc.) and validate via the “Test Connection” button in the UI.
   - If `proxy_fallback_to_direct` is enabled, confirm via logs that the system retried without the proxy when failures occur.
