## User Stories (High-Level)

User stories follow the format: "As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]."

These are preliminary stories. Detailed stories will be created in Phase 4 (Implementation).

---

### EPIC-001: Core Proxy Engine

- As a **developer**, I want to connect my Claude Code CLI to CC Hub so that I can use AI assistance without managing provider configuration.
- As a **developer**, I want my requests to automatically failover to backup providers so that I experience uninterrupted service.
- As an **admin**, I want to add multiple providers with different weights so that I can distribute load according to my service agreements.
- As a **developer**, I want session stickiness so that my conversation context is maintained and cache hits improve.

### EPIC-002: User & Access Management

- As an **admin**, I want to create API keys for team members so that each person has individual access with tracked usage.
- As an **admin**, I want to set rate limits per user so that I can prevent any single user from exhausting our quota.
- As a **developer**, I want to see my remaining quota so that I can plan my AI usage accordingly.

### EPIC-003: Monitoring & Analytics

- As an **admin**, I want to see real-time dashboard of active sessions so that I can monitor system health.
- As an **admin**, I want to view usage reports by user and time period so that I can understand cost allocation.
- As an **admin**, I want to see provider health status so that I can proactively address issues.

### EPIC-004: Administration Console

- As an **admin**, I want to configure error handling rules so that transient errors are automatically retried.
- As an **admin**, I want to filter sensitive content so that our usage complies with company policies.
- As an **admin**, I want to update model pricing so that cost calculations remain accurate.

### EPIC-005: API Compatibility Layer

- As a **developer using Claude Code**, I want to use standard Claude API endpoints so that I don't need special configuration.
- As a **developer using Codex CLI**, I want to use Response API format so that my existing tooling works.
- As a **developer**, I want to access API documentation so that I can integrate CC Hub into custom tools.

---

## User Flows

### Flow 1: Developer Connects to CC Hub

1. Admin provides developer with API key
2. Developer sets CC Hub URL as API endpoint in Claude Code
3. Developer sets provided API key as authentication
4. Claude Code connects through CC Hub transparently
5. Developer uses AI coding as normal

### Flow 2: Admin Adds New Provider

1. Admin logs into CC Hub admin dashboard
2. Admin navigates to Provider Management
3. Admin clicks "Add Provider"
4. Admin enters provider details (name, URL, API key, type)
5. Admin configures weight, priority, limits
6. Admin enables provider
7. CC Hub begins routing traffic to new provider

### Flow 3: Automatic Failover During Outage

1. Developer sends request to CC Hub
2. CC Hub routes to primary provider
3. Primary provider returns error
4. Circuit breaker records failure
5. CC Hub automatically retries on secondary provider
6. Secondary provider returns success
7. Developer receives response (unaware of failover)
8. After threshold, circuit breaker opens for primary
9. Subsequent requests go directly to secondary

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- Hono (API framework)
- Drizzle ORM (database access)
- Redis (session state, rate limiting)
- PostgreSQL (persistent storage)

### External Dependencies

- Anthropic Claude API
- OpenAI API (for compatible providers)
- Google Gemini API
- Various third-party relay services
- LiteLLM (pricing data sync)

---

## Assumptions

- Users understand what Claude Code or Codex is
- Users already know about multiple AI providers
- Users have a need for intelligent provider scheduling
- Team administrators have Docker-capable servers for deployment
- AI provider APIs will remain relatively stable
- PostgreSQL and Redis are acceptable infrastructure requirements
- Users prefer server-deployed solution over local tools

---

## Out of Scope

- Mobile app version
- Building proprietary AI models
- Providing AI model access for users (BYOP - Bring Your Own Provider model)
- End-user billing/payment processing
- AI model training or fine-tuning
- Content caching (responses not cached)
- Offline mode

---

## Open Questions

1. **Provider Balance APIs:** Which providers expose balance/quota APIs, and what are the authentication requirements?
2. **Electron Client Scope:** Should client support full functionality or just subset for personal use?
3. **Database Abstraction:** How much abstraction is needed for multi-database support while maintaining performance?
4. **Enterprise Features:** Are there enterprise-specific requirements (SSO, SAML, LDAP) to consider?

## Next Steps

### Phase 3: Architecture

Run `/architecture` to create system architecture based on these requirements.

The architecture will address:

- All functional requirements (FRs)
- All non-functional requirements (NFRs)
- Technical stack decisions
- Data models and APIs
- System components

### Phase 4: Sprint Planning

After architecture is complete, run `/sprint-planning` to:

- Break epics into detailed user stories
- Estimate story complexity
- Plan sprint iterations
- Begin implementation
