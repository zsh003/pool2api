**Version:** 1.0
**Project Type:** web-app
**Project Level:** 4

## Executive Summary

CC Hub is an intelligent AI API proxy platform designed for agile development teams, AI-driven development teams, startups, and small-medium software companies. It provides observable, highly available AI coding infrastructure with multi-provider auto-switching, circuit breaker, seamless retry, complete logging, and billing management - ideal for team collaboration and shared usage scenarios.

---

## Problem Statement

### The Problem

Existing solutions have significant limitations:

1. **Local-only solutions** - Cannot manage multiple users; each user must configure providers individually
2. **No auto-switching** - Manual configuration changes required to switch providers
3. **Missing session stickiness** - Critical for AI Coding tools like Claude Code to improve cache hits, reduce costs, and enable proper load balancing

### Why Now?

AI Coding tools (especially CLI tools like Claude Code and Codex) are being widely adopted by software development teams. User practice has proven these tools extend beyond coding - more professions will benefit in the future. The market is ripe for a unified management solution.

### Impact if Unsolved

Without CCH, teams face:

- No unified CLI Coding Agent management center
- No centralized provider scheduling and usage monitoring
- No seamless high availability through auto-switching
- Seriously degraded developer efficiency
- Reduced team enthusiasm and satisfaction with AI tools

---

## Target Audience

### Primary Users

Programmers experienced with AI-assisted development, particularly users of tools like Cursor or GitHub Copilot. They understand how to collaborate with AI and can effectively leverage AI CLI Agent advantages.

### Secondary Users

Newcomers to AI-assisted development: students, interns, or managers/bosses. They benefit from CCH's one-stop access without needing to worry about provider configuration, joining the team's shared infrastructure for AI-driven development.

### User Needs

1. **High availability** - Seamless uptime without interruption
2. **No local configuration** - Zero setup for end users
3. **No ongoing maintenance** - All provider scheduling handled by CCH algorithms and system administrators

---

## Solution Overview

### Proposed Solution

A server-deployed, multi-tenant AI Coding tool scheduling platform that provides unified access to multiple AI providers with intelligent load balancing and automatic failover.

### Key Features

**Core Features (Must-have):**

- Multi-provider management
- Auto-switching between providers
- Auto circuit breaker with recovery
- User-transparent/seamless experience

**Additional Features:**

- Multi-tenant support
- Request logging
- Billing/cost tracking
- Session details
- Extensible API for secondary development

### Value Proposition

CCH occupies a unique niche as a server-deployed, multi-tenant AI Coding tool scheduling platform. Competitors either run locally (can't support team collaboration), lack optimization for AI Coding tools and real team workflows, or have less stable scheduling algorithms. CCH is purpose-built for this use case.

---

## Business Objectives

### Goals

- Establish CCH as the recognized open-source AI Coding proxy platform
- Grow community awareness and adoption
- Build a community willing to use and contribute to CCH
- Sustainable development through sponsorship model
- Expand product line (server + client versions in future)

### Success Metrics

- Community recognition and adoption
- Users willing to use CCH
- Contributors willing to help maintain CCH
- Growing awareness in the AI Coding tool ecosystem

### Business Value

Community-driven open-source success - more users, more contributors, stronger ecosystem. The project operates under MIT license with sponsorship-based sustainability.

## Scope

### In Scope

**Current:**

- Multi-provider management (claude, claude-auth, codex, gemini, openai-compatible)
- Auto-switching and circuit breaker
- Session stickiness (5-min context caching)
- Multi-tenant support
- Request logging and billing
- Format converters (Claude, OpenAI, Codex, Gemini)

**Mid-term:**

- Provider management refactoring
- Provider balance/quota fetching
- Intelligent scheduling based on real-time balance and quota data

**Long-term:**

- Database flexibility (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)
- Electron client version
- Full-chain integration (client + server parallel strategy)

### Out of Scope

- Mobile app version
- Building proprietary AI models
- Providing AI model access for users (BYOP - Bring Your Own Provider model)

### Future Considerations

- Provider balance/quota fetching with intelligent scheduling
- Multi-provider format conversion enhancements
- Lightweight client deployment option

---

## Key Stakeholders

- **Maintainer(s)** - High influence. Core development, roadmap decisions, community management
- **Sponsors** - High influence. Funding sustainability, feature priority input
- **Community Contributors** - Medium influence. Code contributions, bug reports, feature requests
- **Users** - Medium influence. Adoption, feedback, issue reporting

---

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints

- Limited development manpower (open-source, volunteer-based)
- Sponsorship-dependent funding model

### Assumptions

- Users understand what Claude Code or Codex is
- Users already know about multiple AI providers
- Users have a need for intelligent provider scheduling
- Team administrators have Docker-capable servers for deployment
- AI provider APIs will remain relatively stable

---

## Success Criteria

- Community recognition and positive reputation
- Recommendations from KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders) in the developer/AI community
- Being recognized as a go-to solution for AI Coding proxy needs
- Active and growing contributor community

---

## Timeline and Milestones

### Target Launch

No fixed schedule - development driven by available maintainer/contributor capacity.

### Key Milestones

Milestones prioritized by community needs and feasibility:

- Provider management refactoring (mid-term)
- Provider balance/quota fetching (mid-term)
- Multi-database support (long-term)
- Electron client version (long-term)

---

## Risks and Mitigation

- **Risk:** Technical Debt
  - **Likelihood:** Medium-High
  - **Mitigation:** Raise code review standards, improve code quality, maintain documentation

- **Risk:** Maintainer Shortage / Project Abandonment
  - **Likelihood:** Medium
  - **Mitigation:** Grow user base, build active community, attract contributors through good documentation and welcoming environment

---

## Next Steps

1. Create Product Requirements Document (PRD) - `/prd`
2. Conduct user research (optional) - `/research`
3. Create UX design (if UI-heavy) - `/create-ux-design`
