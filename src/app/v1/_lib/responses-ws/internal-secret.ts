/**
 * Per-process internal secret for the WS -> HTTP loopback tunnel.
 *
 * Why this exists:
 * - server.js accepts client WebSocket upgrades on /v1/responses and tunnels
 *   each frame as an internal HTTP POST against the same listener. To let the
 *   forwarder know the request originated from a real WS client (so it
 *   should attempt an upstream WebSocket dial), we attach internal marker
 *   headers (x-cch-client-transport: websocket, x-cch-responses-ws-forward:
 *   1).
 * - Those headers travel over plain HTTP and would also be settable by an
 *   external attacker simply curl'ing /v1/responses with the right header
 *   names. Without an authentication step, that lets any HTTP client trick
 *   the forwarder into attempting an upstream WS dial.
 *
 * How this fixes it:
 * - At startup the custom server populates `CCH_RESPONSES_WS_INTERNAL_SECRET`
 *   in `process.env` with a single, random per-process secret (or a value
 *   provided by the operator). The custom server adds that secret as the
 *   `x-cch-internal-secret` header on every internal tunnel request.
 * - The eligibility check in the forwarder cross-checks the secret against
 *   the live process value. Internal requests pass; external requests fail
 *   even if they spoof the public marker headers.
 * - server.js ALSO strips any inbound `x-cch-*` headers from the client WS
 *   handshake before tunneling, so this secret is never echoed back to a
 *   third party. That is defense-in-depth on top of the secret check.
 *
 * The secret never leaves this Node process and is never logged.
